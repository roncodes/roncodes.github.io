            My earliest dream career was to be a comic book artist, work with stan lee and create comics. At an early age I was always drawing, 
            but now that I'm older art and digital art is more of a relaxing hobby for me. It's one of my favorite hobbies as it allows me to 
            bring my visions to life in some form. On this page I will be working on showcasing some of my favorite digital art as I continue my hobby.
